# Building Auto Scaling Groups with Machine Learning Predictive Scaling

### Overall
In this lab, you'll learn how to design and implement an **intelligent Auto Scaling system** on AWS that uses **Machine Learning** to forecast traffic patterns and **scale proactively**.  
You will set up a reactive scaling baseline, build a data pipeline, train forecasting models (LSTM/ARIMA), deploy a real-time prediction API, and implement proactive scaling logic.  
Finally, you will perform A/B testing to compare predictive scaling with traditional reactive scaling, and then clean up all resources.
