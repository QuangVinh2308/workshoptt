Organize processed datasets for efficient storage and retrieval during model training and inference.

**Recommendations:**
- Store processed datasets in **Amazon S3** in CSV or Parquet format for compatibility with AWS SageMaker and other ML tools.
- Use structured folder naming conventions, e.g., `s3://project-name/data/processed/YYYY/MM/DD/`.
- Enable versioning on the S3 bucket to preserve historical versions of the dataset.
- Implement proper IAM policies to restrict access to sensitive data.

Storing data in S3 ensures scalability, durability, and integration with AWS analytics and ML services.
