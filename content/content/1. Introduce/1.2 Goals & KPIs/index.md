## 1.2 Goals & KPIs

**Goals:**
- Implement an intelligent Auto Scaling system that scales proactively based on predicted traffic instead of reacting after demand changes.
- Integrate AWS CloudWatch metrics with external data sources to improve prediction accuracy.
- Use LSTM/ARIMA models to forecast workload patterns and optimize scaling decisions.
- Deploy a real-time prediction API to automate scaling adjustments.
- Reduce infrastructure costs while maintaining or improving application performance.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- **Cost Savings (%)** – Reduction in EC2 costs compared to baseline reactive scaling.
- **Prediction Accuracy (MAPE/RMSE)** – Error rate of traffic forecasts from ML models.
- **Scaling Latency Reduction (seconds)** – Time improvement between traffic spike and scaling action.
- **Uptime (%)** – Percentage of time the system maintains target performance levels.
- **Performance Improvement (%)** – Increase in request throughput or decrease in average response time during peak loads.
