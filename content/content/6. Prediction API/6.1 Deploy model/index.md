Deploy the selected forecasting model for production use.

**Deployment Options:**
- **AWS SageMaker Endpoint**: Managed, scalable, and easy to integrate with AWS Lambda.
- **Docker Container on ECS/EKS**: Full control over environment and scaling.
- **EC2 Instance Hosting**: Simple for low-scale setups.

**Best Practices:**
- Use **versioned model artifacts** from Amazon S3.
- Enable **auto-scaling** for the endpoint to handle high request volumes.
- Monitor latency and error rates with **CloudWatch Metrics**.
