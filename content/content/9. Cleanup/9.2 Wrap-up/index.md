This project demonstrated how **Machine Learning-powered predictive scaling** can enhance AWS Auto Scaling Groups.

**Key Outcomes:**
- **Improved Performance**: Predictive scaling reduced latency during peak loads compared to reactive scaling.
- **Cost Optimization**: Lower EC2 usage costs by scaling proactively.
- **Accurate Forecasting**: LSTM and ARIMA models provided reliable short-term traffic predictions.

**Lessons Learned:**
- High-quality datasets greatly improve model accuracy.
- Combining predictive and reactive scaling can provide a safety net for unexpected traffic spikes.
- Continuous monitoring and retraining of models are essential to maintain accuracy over time.

The final deliverables include all configuration files, ML models, A/B testing results, and detailed documentation of the system architecture and accuracy metrics.
