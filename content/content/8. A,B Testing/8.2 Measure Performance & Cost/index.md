Analyze the results from A/B testing to quantify the benefits of predictive scaling.

**Metrics to Evaluate:**
- **Latency**: Average and 95th percentile response times.
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests.
- **Cost**: EC2 usage cost, overhead from scaling actions.

**Reporting:**
- Visualize metrics in **CloudWatch Dashboards**.
- Generate a comparative report showing performance and cost differences.
- Document findings for inclusion in the final project report.
