Run both reactive and predictive scaling configurations simultaneously, each serving a portion of the workload.

**Testing Steps:**
1. Deploy two identical environments â€” one using reactive scaling, one using predictive scaling.
2. Distribute traffic evenly between both environments.
3. Monitor performance metrics (latency, error rates) and cost data for each setup.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Predictive scaling should reduce latency during peak loads.
- Cost savings should be observed due to optimized scaling decisions.
